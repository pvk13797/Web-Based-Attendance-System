# Web Based Attendance System

Over the years the manual attendance management has been carried across most of educational institutions. To overcome the problems of manual attendance, I have developed “web based attendance System”. Attendance System is based on web server, which can be implemented on any computer. In This application, JSP is server side language, MySQL and JSP is used as back-end design and HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used as front-end tools. The system communicates with database residing on a remote server. It calculates automatically, the attendance percentage of students without any manual paper-based work. The system facilitates the end users with interactive design and automated processing of attendance system.
